# No-Build: Simplifying Development with Ready-to-Use Templates

No Build is a collection of starter repositories that do not require any build tools (such as webpack, esbuild, or vite). These templates are designed to be simple and efficient, allowing developers to jump right into their projects without the hassle of configuring build tools.

## Why No Build?

One might wonder why no build templates are necessary when using CDNs should be enough. Ideally, importing packages through CDNs should eliminate the need for build tools. However, the reality is that many packages do not function properly without the use of build tools, and modifications are often required to make them work seamlessly.

Moreover, the primary goal of no build is to help developers get things done quickly and efficiently. By providing basic templates, the no build approach aims to further this mission by simplifying the development process and allowing developers to focus on their core tasks.

## Key Benefits of No Build Templates:

1. **Simplicity**: No build templates eliminate the need for complicated build tool configurations, making it easier for developers to start working on their projects right away.
2. **Speed**: With no build tools to slow down the development process, projects can be completed more quickly and efficiently.
3. **Compatibility**: No build templates are designed to work seamlessly with various packages, reducing the need for extensive modifications.
4. **Focus on Development**: By removing the need to manage build tools, developers can focus on writing code and creating amazing applications.

In conclusion, no build templates offer a streamlined approach to development, allowing developers to create projects quickly and efficiently without the added complexity of build tools. By providing a solid foundation for development, these templates enable developers to focus on their core tasks and bring their ideas to life more easily.
